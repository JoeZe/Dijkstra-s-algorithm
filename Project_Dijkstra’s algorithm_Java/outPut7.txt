The path form 4 to 1: 1 <- 6 <- 4: costs= 8
The path form 4 to 2: 2 <- 6 <- 4: costs= 8
The path form 4 to 3: 3 <- 1 <- 6 <- 4: costs= 13
The path form 4 to 4: 4 <- 4: costs= 0
The path form 4 to 5: 5 <- 4: costs= 5
The path form 4 to 6: 6 <- 4: costs= 3
The path form 4 to 7: 7 <- 6 <- 4: costs= 5
The path form 4 to 8: 8 <- 5 <- 4: costs= 8
