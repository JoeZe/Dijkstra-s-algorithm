Source node = 6
The shortest paths from the source nodes 6 are:
The path form 6 to 1: 1 <- 6: costs= 5
The path form 6 to 2: 2 <- 6: costs= 5
The path form 6 to 3: 3 <- 1 <- 6: costs= 10
The path form 6 to 4: 4 <- 7 <- 6: costs= 6
The path form 6 to 5: 5 <- 4 <- 7 <- 6: costs= 11
The path form 6 to 6: 6 <- 6: costs= 0
The path form 6 to 7: 7 <- 6: costs= 2
The path form 6 to 8: 8 <- 2 <- 6: costs= 7
