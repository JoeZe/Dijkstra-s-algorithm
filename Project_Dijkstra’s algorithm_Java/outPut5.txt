Source node = 3
The shortest paths from the source nodes 3 are:
The path form 3 to 1: 1 <- 8 <- 2 <- 3: costs= 10
The path form 3 to 2: 2 <- 3: costs= 2
The path form 3 to 3: 3 <- 3: costs= 0
The path form 3 to 4: 4 <- 3: costs= 5
The path form 3 to 5: 5 <- 4 <- 3: costs= 10
The path form 3 to 6: 6 <- 4 <- 3: costs= 8
The path form 3 to 7: 7 <- 8 <- 2 <- 3: costs= 6
The path form 3 to 8: 8 <- 2 <- 3: costs= 4
